Test-Status-by-Test-Set
================================

This app conveys test status for a given iteration in 3 sections:

- First, a summary, which includes each test set ID and name, percentage of tests executed, percentage of tests passing, number passed, number failed, etc.
- Second, a list of the tests which have been run and whether they passed or failed in their last run.
- Third, a list of the tests which are remaining to be run.

To have the grids open all the time instead of one at a time, simply comment out the "accordion" line from near the top of the code.
